Dynaflo is a DynamoDB client for node that was inspired by RethinkDB's fluent query syntax. It was 
built and is maintained by the team at Gravity Labs but we always welcome pull requests.

We built Dynaflo out of the frustration that came from working with AWS's DynamoDB SDK.
There are other DynamoDB clients out there, but we felt they were missing functionality or 
are simply not being maintained.

Our goal for Dynaflo is to make working with DynamoDB more familiar to JavaScript developers. We 
think you will enjoy the syntax and the Promises.
