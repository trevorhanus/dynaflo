Dynanode is a DynamoDB client for node that was inspired by RethinkDB's syntax. It was 
built and is maintained by the team at Gravity Labs but we welcome pull requests.

We built Dynanode out of the frustration that came from working with the AWS DynamoDB SDK.
There are other DynamoDB clients out there, but we felt they were missing functionality or 
are simply not being maintained.

Our goal for Dynanode is to make working with DynamoDB more familiar to JavaScript developers. We 
think you will enjoy the syntax and the Promises.
